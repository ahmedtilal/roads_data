# Transportation Data Project

- In this project I'm exploring different data sources providing information about roads in the UK.
- The idea is to first explore the data sources available as I find more and more, and then build an ingestion pipeline using Apache Airflow.
- When I have enough data to be able to build some kind of data warehouse, I will then start implementing a dashboarding system where I can showcase the transportation data.
- We can then start having a deep dive into analysing these datasets and build a model to provide suggestions.

P.S:
- I am finding ideas as I go, I do not have a concrete idea about what I'm building, what I find guides my next step.
- This is iteration 1. Each iteration will be in a branch, and once I finish with an iteration, I merge it with master branch.
